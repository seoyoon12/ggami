  <h2><strong>Who is he?</h2>
    <p>Hello, My name is Ggami and I was born in April,2003.<br> I have 4 human family member and 1 dog mother named 'Yebbi'.<br>
      I had so much love and attention from my family during my lifetime.<br> As you know, I died last month, September,2020. It was a quite long time.<br>
      After Yebbi died, I didn't want to live no longer.. literally her death was a huge shock to me.<br> Now that I think about it, I'm sorry to my human family.<br>
      I hope they know that I was a super lucky dog and really happy with Yebbi now.<br> </p>
